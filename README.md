# Face-spoofing-detection-on-NUAA-dataset
NUAA is a face spoofing dateset containing almost 11000 images, on this dataset spoofed vs original classification is done

The whole project is done in three steps
In the first step the MTCNNE face detector is used
In the second step Facenet is used to detect facial features
In the final step a classifier is used.

Facenet keras model is uploaded in this repository

train and test dataset are seprately filtered and preprocessed for efficiency in two separate notebooks and classifier is present in a third notebook
